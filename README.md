Network IPs

This two programs withinIP() and listIP() are just functions for checking if an IP exists within a range, or list all IP's in a range, given the range is in the below format. The code can easily be manipulated to take two raw IP's as the range:


x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y
0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255
